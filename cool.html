	<img src="star.png" width="46">I will call you two days before the party to go over the details
one last time and to get the final guest count. Rest assured, your
booking is now confirmed.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px"><span class="bold">Cancellation Policy</span><br><br>
Since I turn away other clients to hold your event date and time, any cancellations (for any
reason) will result in the forfeit of the deposit. However, you will have 365 days to re-schedule the
cancelled booking and the initial deposit will be applied to the new booking*. If for any reason,
I'm sick on the day of the performance, I will notify you of my health and it will be your choice if
you would still like me to entertain at your event. (There's nothing some RedBull can't help!) If
you would prefer me not to perform due to me being sick, a suitable replacement may be found or
the deposit will be returned to you in full, within 14 days. In the event of a medical emergency,
(This has never happened and I've been performing for over 16 years) a suitable replacement
may be found or the deposit will be returned to you in full, within 14 days. No other renumeration
other than the initial deposit, will be paid to the client or the performer if either party cancels.
*Based upon my availability.</p>
